'''
Prompts the user for a seed for the random number generator,
and for a strictly positive number, nb_of_elements.
Generates a list of nb_of_elements random integers between 0 and 99,
prints out the list, computes the maximum element of the list without using the
builtin max(), prints it out, and confirms that the value is correct with the builtin.
