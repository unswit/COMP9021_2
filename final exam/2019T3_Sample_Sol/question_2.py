'''
You might find the function bin() useful.
Will be tested with n a strictly positive integer.

    '''
    >>> f(1)
    1 in binary reads as: 1.
    Only one bit is set to 1 in the binary representation of 1.

    2 in binary reads as: 10.
    Only one bit is set to 1 in the binary representation of 2.
    >>> f(3)
    3 in binary reads as: 11.
    2 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 3.
    >>> f(7)
    7 in binary reads as: 111.
    3 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 7.
    >>> f(2314)
    2314 in binary reads as: 100100001010.
    4 bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of 2314.
