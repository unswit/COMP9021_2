# Implements a function that, based on the encoding of
# a single strictly positive integer that in base 2,
# reads as b_1 ... b_n, as b_1b_1 ... b_nb_n, encodes
# a sequence of strictly positive integers N_1 ... N_k
# with k >= 1 as N_1* 0 ... 0 N_k* where for all 0 < i <= k,
# N_i* is the encoding of N_i.
#
# Implements a function to decode a positive integer N
# into a sequence of (one or more) strictly positive
# integers according to the previous encoding scheme,
# or return None in case N does not encode such a sequence.

# for validity, nor to take action in case it is invalid.
