The generated mapping is:
   {1: 3, 2: 18, 3: 15, 4: 14, 7: 11, 8: 9, 9: 12, 12: 8, 13: 11, 14: 18, 15: 18, 16: 16, 17: 18, 18: 13, 19: 8}

The keys are, from smallest to largest: 
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Properly ordered, the cycles given by the mapping are: 
   [[8, 9, 12], [16]]

The (triply ordered) reversed dictionary per lengths is: 
{1: {3: [1], 9: [8], 12: [9], 13: [18], 14: [4], 15: [3], 16: [16]},
