# Quiz 4 *** Due Thursday Week 5
#
# Prompts the user for an arity (a natural number) n and a word.
# Call symbol a word consisting of nothing but alphabetic characters
# and underscores.
# Checks that the word is valid, in that it satisfies the following
# inductive definition:
# - a symbol, with spaces allowed at both ends, is a valid word;
# - a word of the form s(w_1,...,w_n) with s denoting a symbol and
#   w_1, ..., w_n denoting valid words, with spaces allowed at both ends
#   and around parentheses and commas, is a valid word.
